# Learning Generative AI and Agentic AI

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing core concepts of Generative AI and Agentic AI, focusing on modern frameworks and methodologies for building intelligent agent-based systems.

## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 1. Pydantic
- Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
- Schema definition and validation for AI models
- Integration with FastAPI and other modern Python frameworks

### 2. Prompt Engineering
- Best practices for crafting effective prompts
- Techniques for zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought prompting
- Prompt templates and dynamic prompt generation
- System and user role definitions

### 3. Multi-Agent Conversation Programming (MCP) & Agent-to-Agent (A2A)
- Building multi-agent systems
- Agent communication protocols
- Role-based agent interactions
- Task delegation and coordination
- Collaborative problem-solving

### 4. LangGraph
- Building complex AI workflows
- State management in LLM applications
- Graph-based conversation flows
- Integration with LangChain

### 5. CrewAI
- Team-based AI agent frameworks
- Role-specific agent implementation
- Task planning and execution
- Hierarchical agent structures

### 6. AutoGen
- Automated agent generation
- Multi-agent conversation frameworks
- Flexible conversation patterns
- Integration with various LLM providers
